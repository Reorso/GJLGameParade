  - text: 'It had been a mistake. The apartment was in pieces, shattered glass on
      the floor and belongings thrown everywhere in an attempt to locate anything
      of value. The tv was gone, the fancy watch your father had bought you for graduation
      too. Chris was still on the floor where they left, curled up around the knee
      they had kicked in when Chris tried to stop them.<br><br> This was a mess,
      and it was all your fault. '
